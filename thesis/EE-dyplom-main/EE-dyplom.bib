Interoperability is a benefit of standardization across every layer of the entire
communications stack — from the physical layer, dealing with the analogue world
of radio at the bottom, to user level behaviors that products may exhibit at the
top. The Bluetooth mesh specifications define those product behaviors in terms
of granular, standard building blocks called models. This paper provides a guided

	abstract = {Mesh networks enable a many-to-many relation between nodes, which means that each node in the network can communicate with every other node using multi-hop communication and path diversity. As it enables the fast roll-out of sensor and actuator networks, it is an important aspect within the Internet of Things (IoT). Utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as an underlying technology to implement such mesh networks has gained a lot of interest in recent years. The result was a variety of BLE meshing solutions that were not interoperable because of the lack of a common standard. This has changed recently with the advent of the Bluetooth Mesh standard. However, a detailed overview of how this standard operates, performs and how it tackles other issues concerning BLE mesh networking is missing. Therefore, this paper investigates this new technology thoroughly and evaluates its performance by means of three approaches, namely an experimental evaluation, a statistical approach and a graph-based simulation model, which can be used as the basis for future research. Apart from showing that consistent results are achieved by means of all three approaches, we also identify possible drawbacks and open issues that need to be dealt with.},

In the academic community Mesh protocols on top of the BLE topology are currently being researched. Recently, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) released a flooding-based solution. Even though the usage of a mesh network is highly dependent on the use case, the connection-based solution has a low power consumption in a scenario where some end-to-end delay is allowed in the network. Such application could be sensor networks where some lag is allowed in the data collected from sensors. This paper presents a study of the current drain in a connection-based routing mesh topology called FruityMesh and discusses its possibilities for use in off-grid environments.},

	abstract = {A smart city application has been realized and tested. It is a fully remote controlled isle of lamp posts based on new technologies. It has been designed and organized in different hierarchical layers, which perform local activities to physically control the lamp posts and transmit information with another for remote control. Locally, each lamp post uses an electronic card for management and a ZigBee tlc network transmits data to a central control unit, which manages the whole isle. The central unit is realized with a Raspberry-Pi control card due to its good computing performance at very low price. Finally, a WiMAX connection was tested and used to remotely control the smart grid, thus overcoming the distance limitations of commercial Wi-Fi networks. The isle has been realized and tested for some months in the field.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, wireless Internet of Things (IoT) devices are considered as an integral part of home and industrial automation systems or environmental monitoring. In recent years, many new wireless protocols based on various hardware and software solutions have been developed and introduced into the market. In this publication, a comparison of Thread mesh with Bluetooth Mesh, Zig-Bee, NB-IoT, Sigfox and LoRa is shown. Smart Home, Smart City and Rural area requirements for wireless connectivity are analyzed. In addition, the usability of the Thread and others in the Internet of Things, Services and People (IoTSP) applications is considered. The Thread protocol is based on IEEE 802.15.4 radio standard featuring 2.4 GHz radio connectivity. The paper also describes examples of applications created during study of Thread. The Presented solution is based on NRF52840 SoC (System on chip) and OpenThread - the opensource software implementation of the Thread protocol stack.},

The use of Bluetooth provided us with fast, flexible and reliable data collection in a complex conference environment. In this document we present a brief introduction of Bluetooth Mesh Network (ie, Architecture, Models, Topology, Application) and how it is integrated and integrated with Bluetooth Low Energy. In addition, we provide details on the strengths, weaknesses, security of the Bluetooth mesh and the comparison of wireless networks such as Bluetooth Mesh, Zigbee and Thread and many more.},
