Interoperability is a benefit of standardization across every layer of the entire
communications stack — from the physical layer, dealing with the analogue world
of radio at the bottom, to user level behaviors that products may exhibit at the
top. The Bluetooth mesh specifications define those product behaviors in terms
of granular, standard building blocks called models. This paper provides a guided

	abstract = {Mesh networks enable a many-to-many relation between nodes, which means that each node in the network can communicate with every other node using multi-hop communication and path diversity. As it enables the fast roll-out of sensor and actuator networks, it is an important aspect within the Internet of Things (IoT). Utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as an underlying technology to implement such mesh networks has gained a lot of interest in recent years. The result was a variety of BLE meshing solutions that were not interoperable because of the lack of a common standard. This has changed recently with the advent of the Bluetooth Mesh standard. However, a detailed overview of how this standard operates, performs and how it tackles other issues concerning BLE mesh networking is missing. Therefore, this paper investigates this new technology thoroughly and evaluates its performance by means of three approaches, namely an experimental evaluation, a statistical approach and a graph-based simulation model, which can be used as the basis for future research. Apart from showing that consistent results are achieved by means of all three approaches, we also identify possible drawbacks and open issues that need to be dealt with.},

In the academic community Mesh protocols on top of the BLE topology are currently being researched. Recently, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) released a flooding-based solution. Even though the usage of a mesh network is highly dependent on the use case, the connection-based solution has a low power consumption in a scenario where some end-to-end delay is allowed in the network. Such application could be sensor networks where some lag is allowed in the data collected from sensors. This paper presents a study of the current drain in a connection-based routing mesh topology called FruityMesh and discusses its possibilities for use in off-grid environments.},

It has been designed and organized in different hierarchical layers, which perform local activities to physically control the lamp posts and transmit information with another for remote control. Locally, each lamp post uses an electronic card for management and a ZigBee tlc network transmits data to a central control unit, which manages the whole isle. The central unit is realized with a Raspberry-Pi control card due to its good computing performance at very low price. Finally, a WiMAX connection was tested and used to remotely control the smart grid, thus overcoming the distance limitations of commercial Wi-Fi networks. The isle has been realized and tested for some months in the field.},

As a new technology in the Internet of Things (IoT) market, it is crucial to investigate the performance of Bluetooth Mesh. However, while a fundamental feature of Bluetooth Mesh is its suitability for energy-constrained devices, this aspect has not yet been properly considered in the literature. In this paper, we model the current consumption, lifetime and energy cost per delivered bit of a battery-operated Bluetooth Mesh sensor node. The model is based on measurements performed on a real hardware platform. Evaluation results quantify the impact of crucial Bluetooth Mesh parameters. Among others, we have found that a sensor device running on a simple 235 mAh battery, and sending a data message every 10 s, can achieve a lifetime of up to 15.6 months, whereas the asymptotic lifetime is 21.4 months.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses new challenges arising from the emergence of Bluetooth mesh and its rapid adoption in Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT. One of the main problems associated with Bluetooth mesh is the power consumption of the mesh nodes, since the network needs to be scanned constantly to receive and relay messages. In order to reduce the energy consumption in the nodes where possible, the friendship mechanism is provided as a solution by the Bluetooth mesh specification. The friendship mechanism enables Low Power Nodes (LPNs) to spend most of their lifetime in sleep mode without losing the messages addressed to them. For this purpose, a node that is constantly in scan mode, called friend node (FN), stores these messages, sending them on request. This mechanism works with a stop-and-wait protocol, resulting in inefficient channel utilisation. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no proposals for the improvement of this mechanism, likely due to its novelty. This paper studies different approaches for the improvement of the friendship mechanism: improving the Bearer Layer, improving time synchronisation and improving advertising channel utilisation. The results of this study reveal that each of the proposals presents a limitation that makes its final implementation unfeasible, and thus the challenge arises of developing a proposal for its optimisation. Accordingly, this work presents a proposal to improve the friendship mechanism with Burst Transmissions and Listen Before Transmit (BTLBT), which has been evaluated and validated in real hardware platforms. The results obtained for 4 LPNs show a reduction in the time required to receive the FN messages, as well as a 66.65\% reduction in the time required to scan for each message. Finally, a consumption study is presented, where the results show that our proposal achieves a 19.81\% improvement in lifetime compared to the standard friendship mechanism.},

	abstract = {BLE is a widely used short-range technology which has gained a relevant position inside the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm development thanks to its simplicity, low-power consumption, low-cost and robustness. New enhancements over BLE have focused on supporting mesh network topology. Compared to other mesh networks, BLE mesh has only considered a managed flooding protocol in its first version. Managed flooding may generally seem inefficient in many contexts, but it is a high desirable option when data transmission is urgent, the network is small or its configuration changes in a very dynamic way. Knowing the interest to many application contexts, this paper analyses the impact of tweaking several features over the reliability and efficiency of the mesh network. These features are configured and controlled in different layers: message repetition schemes, the transmission randomization, the election of a scheme based on an acknowledged or unacknowledged transmission, etc. In order to estimate the real performance of a mesh network deployment, this paper evaluates the effects of the interaction of the chosen parameters, their appropriate adjustment in relation with the characteristics of real implementations and the true overhead related to the whole protocol stack. The paper identifies configuration challenges, proposes network tuning criteria and outlines possible standard improvements. For this purpose, a detailed assessment on the implementation and execution of real devices has been performed with their chipset limitations.},

As it enables the fast roll-out of sensor and actuator networks, it is an important aspect within the Internet of Things (IoT). Utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as an underlying technology to implement such mesh networks has gained a lot of interest in recent years. The result was a variety of BLE meshing solutions that were not interoperable because of the lack of a common standard. This has changed recently with the advent of the Bluetooth Mesh standard. However, a detailed overview of how this standard operates, performs and how it tackles other issues concerning BLE mesh networking is missing. Therefore, this paper investigates this new technology thoroughly and evaluates its performance by means of three approaches, namely an experimental evaluation, a statistical approach and a graph-based simulation model, which can be used as the basis for future research. Apart from showing that consistent results are achieved by means of all three approaches, we also identify possible drawbacks and open issues that need to be dealt with.},

	abstract = {The world has recently witnessed the emergence of huge technological growth in the field of data transmission and smart living through various modes of information and communication technology. For example, edge computing has taken a leading role to embark upon the problems related to the internetwork bandwidth minimization and service latency reduction. Inclusion of small microcontroller chips, smart sensors and actuators in the existing socio-economic sectors have paved the Internet of Things (IoT) to act upon the dissemination of smart services to the end users. Thus, a strong need of understating of the industrial elements of edge computing has become necessary that can share the mutual goal while assimilating with the IoT. This paper advocates the crucial role of industrial standards and elements of the edge computing for the dissemination of overwhelming augmented user experience with conjunction with the IoT. First, we present the taxonomical classification and review the industrial aspects that can benefit from both of the IoT and edge computing scenario, then discuss about each of the taxonomical components in detail. Second, we present two practically implemented use cases that have recently employed the edge-IoT paradigm together to solve urban smart living problems. Third, we propose a novel edge-IoT based architecture for e-healthcare i.e. EH-IoT and developed a demo test-bed. The test results showed promising results towards minimizing dependency over IoT cloud analytics or storage facility. We conclude with discussion on the various parameters such as, architecture, requirement capability, functional issues, and selection criteria, related to the survival of edge-IoT ecosystem incorporation.},
